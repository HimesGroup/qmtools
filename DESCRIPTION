Description: The qmtools (quantitative metabolomics tools) package provides
             basic tools for processing quantitative metabolomics data with the
             standard SummarizedExperiment class. This includes functions for
             imputation, normalization, feature filtering, feature clustering,
             dimension-reduction, and visualization to help users prepare data
             for statistical analysis. Several functions in this package could
             also be used in other types of omics data.
