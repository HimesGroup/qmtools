Description: The qmtools (quantitative metabolomics tools) package provides
             basic tools for processing quantitative metabolomics data with the
             standard SummarizedExperiment class. This includes functions for
             imputation, normalization, feature filtering, feature clustering,
             dimension-reduction, and visualization to help users prepare data
             for statistical analysis. This package also offers a convenient way
             to compute empirical Bayes statistics for which metabolic features
             are different between two sets of study samples. Several functions
             in this package could also be used in other types of omics data.
