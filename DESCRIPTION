Description: The poplin package provides basic tools for processing quantitative
             metabolomics features with the standard SummarizedExperiment class.
             This includes functions for imputation, normalization,
             dimension-reduction, and visualization to help users prepare data
             for statistical analysis. Feature clustering can be performed
             according to retention-times and feature correlations to deal with
             the redundancy of metabolomics features.
